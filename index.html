                  Neurodiverse relationships are wonderfully unique, filled with
                  love, excitement, empathy, and surprises. However, like any
                  relationship, they come with their own set of challenges. When
                  one or both partners have ADHD, these challenges can become
                  more complex, but with the right support, they are manageable.
                  Couples ADHD coaching provides specialized assistance tailored
                  to the distinct needs of relationships impacted by ADHD. Our
                  coaching services are designed to foster understanding and
                  develop effective strategies to manage ADHD symptoms. In our
                  sessions, we will explore how certain behaviors are rooted in
                  neurodiversity while focusing on achievable and sustainable
                  growth. Whether one or both partners have ADHD, it is crucial
                  to educate and validate without excusing behaviors solely due
                  to ADHD. Let us strengthen your bond and deepen your
                  understanding of each other, ensuring a more harmonious and
                  fulfilling relationship.

          "Angel stands out as a brilliant coach for anyone with ADHD. Her lived
          experience with ADHD provides her with a deep, empathetic
          understanding of the unique challenges and strengths associated with
          the condition. She brings authenticity and relatability to her
          coaching, which fosters a genuine connection with those she mentors.
          Her practical insights and strategies, rooted in her personal journey,
          offer real-world solutions that are both effective and compassionate.
          Angel excels at breaking down complex concepts into manageable steps,
          a crucial skill for helping those with ADHD navigate their goals and
          challenges. Her patience, encouragement, and tailored approach make
          her an exceptional coach who can adapt to the diverse needs of her
          clients. Angel embodies the saying, "The best people to learn from are
          the ones who have done it, experienced it, and brought the t-shirt."
          Her first-hand experience and success in managing ADHD not only
          provide hope and inspiration but also demonstrate that she truly

          "I felt so safe with Angel. I disclosed things that I thought were
          serious probelms, but with a little explanation, Angel led me to
          realise that a lot of the things I struggled with were completely
          reasonable. Angel helped me to shake off many years of anxiety and
          self-doubt, and I will be forever grateful." -

          "I have found Angel’s coaching very beneficial; I have more control
          during my deregulations and also coping strategies that prevent
          deregulations. Her coaching thus far has been invaluable and
          incredibly beneficial, I’ve found I’m able to be "zestier" (More
          enerjectic, and joyful in life) each week and manage my ADHD fairly
          well, but if I’m ever unsure I’ve been able to send her a message and
          get a quick response with amazing advice." -

                  effective coping mechanisms. I provide a supportive

        <p class="faq-para">
          <strong>What is ADHD Coaching?</strong> <br />
          ADHD Coaching is a personalized one-on-one form of life coaching
          designed to support individuals with ADHD in navigating their unique
          challenges. Coaching is meant to help you gain to tools, resilience,
          and confidence to not need me as a coach anymore. Our one-on-one
          coaching sessions are tailored to address key areas such as
          organization, rejection sensitivity, imposter syndrome, impulse
          control, emotional regulation, your strengths, your saboteurs and
          more.
          <br /><br /><strong>How often do I need to do sessions?</strong>
          <br />You can do sessions as often as you like, I have clients who are
          weekly, bi-weekly and even monthly. Sessions can be 30 minutes or an
          hour (As we know some ADHD'ers, can't sit for an hour). Clients
          typically do 8 to 12 sessions with me. What do we do in sessions? In
          coaching sessions, we will cover what YOU want to as every person is
          different. We can learn more about ADHD and how it affects you, your
          brain and body and those around you. We will focus on the areas you
          want to focus on and celebrate your wins and goals! In sessions we
          will start with a Win of the Week, go over how your goals from past
          sessions went, talk about what your week looked like and where you are
          struggling, then set new goals for the upcoming session.<br /><br />
          <strong>What are your qualifications?</strong> <br />I have a
          Bachelors degree of honours in Psychology from the University of Kent
          and completed an ADHD Coaching course with ADHDWorks, taught by Leanne
          Maskel, the renowned author, creator, speaker and ADHD advocate. I
          have ADHD myself, but am also surrounded by ADHD'ers such as my
          husband, mother, siblings, and friends all who have ADHD in many
          different ways. I feel this gives me the ability to see that ADHD is
          not a "one size fits all". Every person is different and what helps
          one may not help all. This is why it is important to find what helps
          YOU. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Where do you coach?</strong> <br />I coach from home, so all
          my sessions are remote via Zoom and I coach people all over the world,
          though I am currently in England so I'm on the "BST Time Zone" working
          from 9am to 5pm.

                  Neurodiverse relationships are wonderfully unique, filled with
                  love, excitement, empathy, and surprises. However, like any
                  relationship, they come with their own set of challenges. When
                  one or both partners have ADHD, these challenges can become
                  more complex, but with the right support, they are manageable.
                  Couples ADHD coaching provides specialized assistance tailored
                  to the distinct needs of relationships impacted by ADHD. Our
                  coaching services are designed to foster understanding and
                  develop effective strategies to manage ADHD symptoms. In our
                  sessions, we'll explore how certain behaviors are rooted in
                  neurodiversity and focus on achievable, sustainable growth.
                  Whether one or both partners have ADHD, it is crucial to
                  educate and validate without excusing behaviors solely due to
                  ADHD. Let us strengthen your bond and deepen your
                  understanding of each other, ensuring a more harmonious and
                  fulfilling relationship.

          "Angel stands out as a brilliant coach for anyone with ADHD. Her lived
          experience with ADHD provides her with a deep, empathetic
          understanding of the unique challenges and strengths associated with
          the condition. She brings authenticity and relatability to her
          coaching, which fosters a genuine connection with those she mentors.
          Her practical insights and strategies, rooted in her personal journey,
          offer real-world solutions that are both effective and compassionate.
          Angel excels at breaking down complex concepts into manageable steps,
          a crucial skill for helping those with ADHD navigate their goals and
          challenges. Her patience, encouragement, and tailored approach make
          her an exceptional coach who can adapt to the diverse needs of her
          clients. Angel embodies the saying, "The best people to learn from are
          the ones who have done it, experienced it, and brought the t-shirt."
          Her first-hand experience and success in managing ADHD not only
          provide hope and inspiration but also demonstrate that she truly
          understands what it takes to thrive with this condition." -

          "I felt so safe with Angel. I disclosed things that I thought were
          serious probelms, but with a little explanation, Angel led me to
          realise that a lot of the things I struggled with were completely
          reasonable. Angel helped me to shake off many years of anxiety and
          self-doubt, and I will be forever grateful." -

          "I have found Angel’s coaching very beneficial; I have more control
          during my deregulations and also coping strategies that prevent
          deregulations. Her coaching thus far has been invaluable and
          incredibly beneficial, I’ve found I’m able to be "zestier" (More
          enerjectic, and joyful in life) each week and manage my ADHD fairly
          well, but if I’m ever unsure I’ve been able to send her a message and
          get a quick response with amazing advice." -
